##Data races

####Two threads trying to insert a node in the same place
The list contains the elements 5 and 10, P0 try to insert element 7, and P1 wants to insert 8. Both processors have created their nodes and the states of variables is as follows :

* **P0** : 	previous =  node(5), current = node(10)
* **P1** : 	previous =  node(5), current = node(10)

At some point the following sequence of events happens :

1. **P0** : new_node->next = current; 
2. **P1** : new_node->next = current;
3. **P0** : previous->next = new_node;
4. **P1** : previous->next = new_node;

The effect is that the list now only contains 5,8 and 10. A race between operations **3** and **4** resulted in a unexpected behavior of the list.

###One thread trying to add, one thread trying to delete
